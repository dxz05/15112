This is my term project for the course 15112 - Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University Qatar.

The game is based on the videogame named Hue (2016) developed by Fiddlesticks and published by Curve Digital.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obG3s-t2r3g

To play the game, first download and extract all files into one folder. That folder should contain "hue.py", folder "pic", and folder "levels". Then, download the [cmu_graphics](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop) python library if you haven't done so. Run hue.py to start the game.

Controls:

wasd -> movement

space -> jump

mouse click -> change color

shift + a/d -> push/pull the block
